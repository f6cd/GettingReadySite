Educated in England and Scotland, in the state and independent sectors, he is passionately committed to raising standards in state schools and helping children from less privileged backgrounds to maximise their potential.
                            </p>
                            <p>

Following the 2010 General Election, he served as Secretary of State for Education, and was appointed as Chief Whip in 2014. After the General Election in May 2015, he became Lord Chancellor, Secretary of State for Justice, until July 2016.
